Due to the lack of user focus, **many container platforms have a big developer experience gap**.

That's not only because **building a Kubernetes platform is complex** but also because **deploying applications on Kubernetes requires expertise in many Container and Kubernetes concepts**. And once developers learn them, they still must spend a lot of time maintaining containers, writing YAML templates, and orchestrating many moving Kubernetes parts.
Like in the days when the Waterfall model was the standard for software development, **developers today shouldn't have to care where and how their applications run** and focus on adding business value by implementing new features.

**In this interactive workshop, you will explore some of the powerful open-source technologies available within the Kubernetes ecosystem to close the developer experience gap.**
