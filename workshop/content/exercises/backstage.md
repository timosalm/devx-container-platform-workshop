For a solid developer experience, it's also necessary to provide a developer portal that provides a central location in which you can view dependencies, relationships, technical documentation, and even service status.

[Backstage](https://backstage.io) is an open-source platform for building developer portals based on [React](https://react.dev).

Out of the box, Backstage includes:
- **Backstage Software Catalog** for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.)
- **Backstage Software Templates** for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization's best practices
- **Backstage TechDocs** for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach

Plus, a **growing ecosystem of open-source plugins** that further expand Backstage's customizability and functionality.
